also uses different access keys from the Atlas Administration API and the App
Services Admin API.

To configure access for each API, use these resources:

  * Get Started with the Atlas Administration API

  * App Services Administration API docs

  * Read and Write with the Data API

  * Expose Collection Data with the Atlas GraphQL API

## Admin APIs

### Atlas Administration API

Manage your Atlas environment through the command line or automate with the
Atlas Administration API. Atlas Administration API resources add, edit, or
delete administrative objects within Atlas, including projects, users, and
database deployments.

See the Atlas Admin API Specification

### App Services Admin API

Programmatically perform administrative tasks outside of the App Services UI
with the App Services Admin API. This includes tasks such as modifying
authentication providers, creating rules, and defining functions.

## Data APIs

### Atlas Data API

Programmatically create, read, update, and delete data stored in Atlas with
the Data API. You can use the Data API to access Atlas data from the command
line or from other applications.

### Atlas GraphQL API

Access only the data you need with the Atlas GraphQL API. App Services
automatically generates a GraphQL API for your application based on your data
model. You can extend the API for your app's use cases by writing custom query
and mutation resolvers.
