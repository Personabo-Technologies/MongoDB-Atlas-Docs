# Generate Wildcard Collections

Share Feedback

You can dynamically generate collection names that map to data in your S3
bucket. To dynamically generate collection names, specify the wildcard, `*`,
as the value for the collection name setting in your federated database
instance storage configuration.

You can use the storageSetConfig command to configure the settings for
generating wildcard (`*`) collections.

To generate wildcard collections in your federated database instance storage
configuration that map to data in your S3 bucket, configure the following
settings in your federated database instance storage configuration:

  * Specify `*` as the value for the `databases.[n].collections.[n].name` setting.

  * Specify the `collectionName()` function as the value for the `databases.[n].collections.[n].dataSources.[n].path` setting.

  *  _Optional_. Specify the maximum number of collections to include in the database in the `databases.[n].maxWildcardCollections` setting. By default, Atlas Data Federation generates up to `100` wildcard collections in the database.

## Example

    
    
    "databases" : [  
      
      {  
        "name" : "<db-name>",  
        "collections" : [  
          {  
            "name" : "*",  
            "dataSources" : [  
              {  
                "storeName" : "<s3-store-name>",  
                "path" : "{collectionName()}"  
              }  
            ]  
          }  
        ],  
        "maxWildcardCollections" : <integer>,  
      }  
    ]  
  
You can also use the `create` administration command and the federated
database instance User Interface JSON Editor to configure the settings for
generating wildcard collections. You can't use the federated database instance
User Interface Visual Editor to configure the settings for generating wildcard
collections.
