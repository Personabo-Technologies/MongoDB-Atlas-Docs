## As an existing MongoDB Cloud Manager account holder, how do I create a new
MongoDB Atlas project?

When creating a new Project, Cloud Manager offers you the choice to create a
Cloud Manager project or an Atlas project.

To learn how to create a project, see Manage Projects.

## How do I restore lost access to organizations and projects?

If you created your Atlas account using a Gmail or Google Apps account, the
following can cause you to lose access to your organizations and projects:

  * The Google email address with which you signed up differs from the email address associated to your account. This is most often the case with Gmail or Google Apps aliases.

  * Your username or email domain has changed in Google Apps.

To re-gain access to your organizations and projects:

  * Ask an Atlas user with the `Organization Owner` to invite you to the organization to which you lost access, or

  * Contact MongoDB Support.

## How do I remove my project?

You can remove a project if:

  * You have the `Project Owner` role for the project.

  * The project has no outstanding invoices.

  * The project has no active database deployments.

To delete a project for an organization, you can delete from the
organization's Projects view or the project's Project Setting view. For
details, see Delete a Project.

## How do I delete my Atlas account?

To delete your Atlas account, see Delete an Atlas Account.

## Important

You can't reuse the email address associated with the deleted account to
create a new Atlas account.

To learn more, see Request Support.
