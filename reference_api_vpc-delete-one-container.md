This API reference is deprecated. It will be removed in a future release. For
the latest API reference, see the MongoDB Atlas Administration API
Specification. This new API specification might take several seconds to load.
MongoDB appreciates your patience as it improves this experience.

Remove one unprovisioned Network Peering container in one project. You must
have the `Project Owner` role or the `Organization Owner` role to successfully
call this endpoint.

## Note

Groups and projects are synonymous terms. Your `{GROUP-ID}` is the same as
your project ID. For existing groups, your group/project ID remains the same.
The resource and corresponding endpoints use the term `groups`.

Base URL: `https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v1.0`
