## How do I get support for my Atlas database deployments?

Using the in-app chat or opening a support case, request support through the
Atlas console. Support for development and performance of the database
requires an upgraded support plan.

For more information on support plans or to subscribe to an upgraded support
plan, you can either:

  * Contact MongoDB Support, or

  * Navigate to your organization's Support tab in the Atlas console.
