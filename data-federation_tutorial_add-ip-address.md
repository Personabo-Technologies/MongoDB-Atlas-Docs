# Add Your IP Address to the IP Access List

Share Feedback

An IP address is a unique numeric identifier for a device connecting to a
network. Within Atlas, you can create a list of trusted IP addresses that can
connect to your federated database instance and access your data. Atlas only
allows connections to a federated database instance from addresses listed in
the IP access list.

## Note

If you already added your IP address in your project's IP access list and
created a MongoDB user, you can proceed to Connect Using the MongoDB Shell.
