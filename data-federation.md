What You Can Do

## Flexibility for Your Data

Data Federation provides the capability to federate queries across data stored
in various supported storage formats, including Atlas Clusters, Data Lake
Datasets, AWS S3 Buckets, and HTTP Stores. You can derive insights or move
data between any of the supported storage formats of the service.

### Connect Your S3 Bucket

Utilize the wizard to create a Federated Database and provide credentials to
your S3 bucket allowing access to Data Federation.

See Configuration for S3 Data Store.

2

### Map Your Virtual Collections

Utilize the Visual Builder or the JSON of your Storage Configuration to map
source cluster data to Virtual Collections inside your federated database
instance.

See Deploy a Federated Database Instance.

### Run `$out` to S3

Use any MongoDB Compatible tool (such as Atlas Scheduled Triggers or Apache
Airflow) and orchestrate "$out to S3" operations to write data from your
cluster into Parquet format files in S3.

See $out to S3.
