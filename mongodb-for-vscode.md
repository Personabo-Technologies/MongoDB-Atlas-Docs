To connect to a database deployment with VS Code, copy your connection
information from Atlas and use it to connect using VS Code. You can connect to
a standalone, replica set, or sharded cluster host.

## Copy Your Deployment's Connection Information

To find and copy your deployment's connection information:

1

### Navigate to your Cluster Overview.

Click Database near the top of the Atlas console.

2

### Locate the database deployment to which to connect from the list of
database deployments.

3

### Click the Connect button to the right of your database deployment's name.

A Connect dialog appears with a list of available connection methods.

4

### Select Connect using VS Code.

Follow the directions under Connect using VS Code to create a connection to
your database deployment.

## Create a Connection to a Deployment

For instructions on creating a connection to your database deployment using VS
Code, see Connect to Your MongoDB Deployment in the MongoDB for VS Code
documentation. If you copied your Atlas connection string in the previous
procedure, follow the steps to use your Atlas connection string.

## Tip

The Connect to Your MongoDB Deployment page also provides information on
disconnecting from a deployment and information on activating, renaming and
removing a connection.
