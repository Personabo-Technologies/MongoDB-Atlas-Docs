# CSV and TSV

Share Feedback

Your CSV or TSV file must start with a header row. Atlas Data Federation
utilizes the header row as field names. The dot-delimited field names in the
header row become nested fields or objects in JSON format. For each dot in the
field name, Data Federation creates another level of nesting.

## Example

Suppose your federated database instance is reading a CSV file with content
similar to the following:

    
    
    company,location.state,location.city.name,location.city.street  
      
    "MongoDB", "California", "Palo Alto", "Forest Ave"  
  
For the data fields in the above example CSV file, Data Federation creates the
following JSON document:

    
    
    {  
      
       "company": "MongoDB",  
       "location": {  
          "state": "California",  
          "city": {  
             "name": "Palo Alto",  
             "street": "Forest Ave",  
       }  
    }  
  
Data Federation requires all field names at the same level of nesting to be
unique. The following are examples of invalid field names in the header row:

  * One field duplicates another field at the same level of nesting.

## Example

Consider the following:

    
        company,location,company  
      
  
In the header, `company` is included twice at the same level of nesting.

  * One dot-delimited field duplicates another field at the same level of nesting.

## Example

Consider the following:

    
        company,location,location.city  
      
  
In the header, `location` is both a stand-alone field and dot-delimited field
at the same level of nesting.
