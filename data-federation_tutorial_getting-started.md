## Overview

Atlas Data Federation is MongoDB's solution for querying data stored in low
cost S3 buckets, Atlas clusters, HTTP stores, and Atlas Data Lake datasets
using the MongoDB Query Language. This allows applications to store data in
the appropriate storage solution for its use-case.

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating and connecting to a
sample federated database instance in Atlas, configuring paths to collections
for files stored in S3, and running MongoDB Query Language (MQL) operations.
