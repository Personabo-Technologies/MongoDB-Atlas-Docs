Share Feedback

This section describes the MongoDB query operations that are supported by Data
Federation.

## Important

Some commands have special behavior in Data Federation that differs from
standard MongoDB functionality.

To run a command against your federated database instance, use
db.runCommand():

    
    
    db.runCommand( { <command> } )
