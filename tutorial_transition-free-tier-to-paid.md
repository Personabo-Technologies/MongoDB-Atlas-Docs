# Migrate Data from an `M0` Free Cluster to a Paid Cluster

Share Feedback

Atlas has built-in support for scaling an `M0` free cluster to an `M10+` paid
cluster. See Modify a Cluster for more information.

Alternatively, use mongodump and mongorestore to copy data from your `M0`
cluster to another `M10+` cluster.
