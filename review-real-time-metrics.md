## Note

### Availability

Atlas supports real-time performance metrics for `mongod` or `mongos`
processes and replica set clusters. For sharded clusters, you can view real-
time peformance metrics for each shard replica set. You must have the `Project
Owner` Atlas user role to access the Real Time tab.

To view real-time peformance metrics for a specific Atlas cluster in a
project, click the View Monitoring button for that cluster. Alternatively,
click on the name of the cluster to open the cluster overview, then click the
Metrics tab. From the Metrics tab, click Real Time to open the Real-Time
Performance Panel. Monitoring metrics in real-time allows you to respond to
time-critical issues right away.

Monitor database deployment metrics to identify performance issues and
determine whether your current database deployment meets your requirements.
For more information on the metrics available to monitor your database
deployments, see Review Available Metrics.

For complete documentation on the Atlas real-time performance metrics, see
Real-Time Performance Panel.

### Monitoring Data Storage Granularity

Atlas stores metrics data at increasing granularity levels. For more
