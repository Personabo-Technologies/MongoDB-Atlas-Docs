# Configure S3 Encryption

Share Feedback

Atlas Data Federation can query and analyze unencrypted data in your AWS S3
buckets without additional configuration. However, to read encrypted data or
write data to your S3 buckets using `$out`, Data Federation might require
additional permissions depending on your S3 encryption settings.

The following table describes the required configuration for your federated
database instance to read encrypted data and to use `$out` to write data to S3
for each type of AWS S3 encryption.

AWS S3 Encryption Types

|

Required Data Federation Configuration  
  
|  
  
AES-256

|

Atlas Data Federation supports both reads and writes of data encrypted in S3
buckets using AES-256 AWS Managed Keys by default. No additional configuration
is required.  
  
SSE with Amazon S3-Managed

|

Atlas Data Federation supports both reads and writes of data encrypted in the
S3 buckets using SSE with Amazon S3 Managed Keys by default. No additional
configuration is required.  
  
Customer Managed Symmetric Customer Master Keys

|

Atlas Data Federation can't access data encrypted in the S3 buckets using SSE
Customer Managed Symmetric Customer Master Keys by default. For reads and
writes, you must add permissions similar to the following to the policy
assigned to your IAM role:

    
    
    | {  
      
       "Effect": "Allow",  
       "Action": [  
          "kms:GenerateDataKey",  
          "kms:decrypt"  
       ],  
       "Resource": [  
          "arn:aws:kms:<aws-region>:<role-ID>:key/<master-key>"  
       ]  
     }  
  
To modify the your AWS IAM role trust policy:

  1. Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service page.

  2. Select Roles from the left-side navigation and click on the IAM role to modify.

  3. Select the Trust Relationships tab.

  4. Click the Edit trust relationship button and edit the Policy Document.
