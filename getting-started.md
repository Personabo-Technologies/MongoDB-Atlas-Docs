## Overview

MongoDB Atlas provides an easy way to host and manage your data in the cloud.
This tutorial guides you through creating an Atlas cluster, connecting to it,
and loading sample data.

You can get started with Atlas through the Atlas CLI or the Atlas User
Interface. Select a tab based on how you would like to get started:

Atlas CLI

Atlas UI

To create and authenticate with your Atlas account, create one free database,
load sample data, add your IP address to your project IP access list, create a
MongoDB user, and view your connection string using the Atlas CLI, run the
following command:

    
    
    atlas setup [options]  
      
  
To learn more about the command syntax and parameters, see the Atlas CLI
documentation for atlas setup.

For step-by-step instructions on using this command, see Get Started with
Atlas from the Atlas CLI.
