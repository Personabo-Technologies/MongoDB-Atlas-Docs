An IP is a unique numeric identifier for a device connecting to a network. In
Atlas, you can only connect to a cluster from a trusted IP address. Within
Atlas, you can create a list of trusted IP addresses, referred to as a IP
access list, that can be used to connect to your cluster and access your data.

## Procedure

You must add your IP address to the IP access list before you can connect to
your cluster. To add your IP address to the IP access list:

1

### Click Connect.

  1. Click Database in the top-left corner of Atlas.

  2. In the Database Deployments view, click Connect for the cluster or serverless instance to which you want to connect.

Atlas highlights the Setup connection security step.

2

### Click Add Your Current IP Address.

To secure your MongoDB Atlas cluster, limit access to specified IP addresses.

The menu expands to show the Add a connection IP address modal.

3

### Click Add IP Address.
