## How do I delete the MongoDB Charts instance linked to my Atlas project?

## Important

Deleting a MongoDB Charts instance deletes all data associated with that
instance including dashboards, data sources, and metadata. Once the MongoDB
Charts instance is deleted, this data cannot be recovered.

If you are a `Project Owner`, you can deactivate and delete a MongoDB Charts
instance linked to your Atlas project from your Project Settings.

If you delete your linked MongoDB Charts instance, you can create a new
MongoDB Charts instance for your project at any time. The newly created
instance does not retain any data from previously deleted instances.
