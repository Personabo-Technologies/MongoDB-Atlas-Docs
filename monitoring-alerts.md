Atlas provides built-in tools, alerts, charts, integrations, and logs to help
you monitor your database deployments. Atlas provides the following ways to
monitor your database deployments and improve performance.

## Slow Queries

To optimize your query performance, review the best practices for query
performance. You can also analyze slow queries and troubleshoot slow
operations executed on your clusters.

Use the following built-in tools:

  * Monitor and improve slow queries with the Performance Advisor.

  * Monitor query performance with the Query Profiler.

  * Monitor real-time performance with the Real-Time Performance Panel.

## Schema Design

To optimize your schema design, review our frequently used schema design
patterns. You can also improve your schema. Improve your schema based on
recommendations from the Performance Advisor and the Atlas UI.

## Alerts

To trigger alerts based on alert conditions and to help ensure database
deployment performance, configure alerts and resolve them promptly. You can
configure alerts based on specific conditions for your databases, users,
accounts, and more. When you resolve alerts, you should fix the immediate
problem, implement a long-term solution, and monitor your progress.

## Deployment Metrics

To monitor your database deployment performance, view database deployment
metrics. View historical throughput, performance, and utilization metrics for
your databases. To learn more, review the available metrics.

## Third-Party Integrations

To receive Atlas alerts in various external monitoring services, integrate
with third-party monitoring services.

## MongoDB Logs

To view log messages and system event audit messages, view and download your
MongoDB logs.

## Note

You can configure push-based monitoring integrations for Atlas with DataDog.
You can also pull monitoring data with the Atlas Administration API.

You can configure pull-based logging integrations with jSonar, which can push
to other services like Splunk, and SumoLogic. You can also pull log data every
5 minutes with the Atlas Administration API.
